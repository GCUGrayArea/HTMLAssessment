# SD27 HTML Assessment, end of week 5

A demonstration of basic HTML elements including headers, links, images, tables and forms.

## Topics

Detailed above. There isn't a lot else to talk about due to the very specific list of tasks provided. We have text elements, a table making use of `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes, and a form with several types of input elements.
